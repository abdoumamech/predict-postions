# This project aims to predict player positions using machine learning techniques. The code includes data cleaning, preprocessing, encoding, normalization, and the implementation of a classification algorithm (Logistic Regression) for predicting player positions. Additionally, the code performs data analysis by comparing attributes between players and visualizing data related to the distribution of midfielders' offers in the top leagues worldwide.
Data cleaning: The code includes steps to clean and handle missing data in the player dataset.
Data preprocessing: Various preprocessing techniques, such as feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling outliers, are employed.
Model training: The classification algorithm, Logistic Regression, is implemented to train the model for predicting player positions.
Attribute comparison: The code compares attributes between two players, one predicted as a center back (CB) but capable of playing as a central midfielder (CM), and another player classified as a central midfielder (CM).
Data visualization: Visualizations are generated to analyze the distribution of midfielder offers across different countries in top leagues worldwide.
